- **JDBC Driver**: UCanAccess (for connecting Java to Access database)

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- **UCanAccess JDBC Driver**: Download the latest UCanAccess JAR file and its dependencies (commons-lang, commons-logging, HSQLDB, Jackcess) from [UCanAccess SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ucanaccess/files/).
- **Microsoft Access**: Optional, for viewing or modifying the database directly.

### Database Setup
1. **Database File**: The project uses a Microsoft Access database named `Information.accdb`.
2. **Location**: Update the database path in `ConnectionToDB.java`. The default path is:
   ```java
   String url = "path-to-file";
   ```
   - Place `Information.accdb` in the `src/Resources/` folder of your project.
   - Modify the `url` to match the actual file location on your system (e.g., `D:\\MyProjects\\AirlineTicketingSystem\\src\\Resources\\Information.accdb`).

### IDE Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Talha-Shahid-07/AirlineTicketingSystem.git
   cd AirlineTicketingSystem
   ```
2. **Open Project in IDE**:
   - **NetBeans**: File > Open Project > Select the `AirlineTicketingSystem` folder.
   - **IntelliJ IDEA**: File > Open > Navigate to the `AirlineTicketingSystem` folder.
   - **Eclipse**: File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace > Select the `AirlineTicketingSystem` folder.
3. **Add UCanAccess Libraries**:
   - In your IDE, add the UCanAccess JAR (`ucanaccess-x.x.x.jar`) and its dependencies to the project‚Äôs classpath/libraries via project properties or build path settings.

### Running the Application
1. **Verify Database Path**: Ensure the `url` in `ConnectionToDB.java` points to the correct `Information.accdb` location.
2. **Run the Application**: Locate `AirlineTicketingSystem.java` (contains the `main` method) and run it from your IDE to launch the main application window.

## üí° Usage
